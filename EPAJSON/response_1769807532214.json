While not classified as a hazardous waste under RCRA, asbestos is a hazardous material whose handling, removal, and disposal is regulated under CERCLA and CAA. The estimate assumes that 50% of the U.S. residential building stock was constructed before 1980 and 20% of offices and schools were constructed before 1980 and may contain asbestos containing materials. The estimate further assumes that the amount of asbestos contained in building materials (particularly drywall) is 1% by weight.</p>"

The 500-gallon tank is the most common size propane tank for residential propane use. It is often used for home heating, generator powering, cooking, pool heating, and more. Typically, a home needs to be at least 2,500 square feet, and use propane for multiple appliances for a 500-gallon tank to be appropriate.  The 1,000-gallon propane tank is most often used for large commercial businesses and the agricultural industry and 34% of commercial energy consumption comes from natural gas.</p><p>The estimate for Tanks/Cylinders assumes that 9.5% of single-family residences use propane for heating fuel and 34% use propane for outdoor grilling. The typical propane tank for residential grilling is a 20 pound tank and the typical tank for heating is a 500 gallon tank. It is also assumed that 34% of commercial entities have tanks at an average size of 1,000 gallons. The tanks are assumed to be 80% full.</p>"
