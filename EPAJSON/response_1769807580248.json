    "guidanceHtml": "<p>The Waste Materials Estimator (WME) includes functionality for users to estimate the amount of waste that may result from decontamination and/or remediation activities in open spaces. Because of the wide variety of items and materials that can be found in large open space areas across the U.S., the open space estimation feature of the WME provides only mass and volume estimates of:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Soil,</li>\n<li>Vegetation,</li>\n<li>Asphalt, and</li>\n<li>Concrete.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The amount of waste estimated for each of the four waste categories above is dependent entirely upon the size of the affected area, the percentage of the affected area that is open space, and the quantity (or depth) of materials removed from the ground surface as a result of decontamination and/or remediation activities. Users can model an entire area based on a single set of characteristics or model specific parcels to reflect significant differences within an affected area of open space.</p>\n\n<p>The total affected area, in square miles, is entered on the WME Home Page. The total affected area includes the areas occupied by buildings and other structures, roadways, sidewalks, parks, bodies of water, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The following default parameters may be modified by clicking the Pencil icon after entering the Total affected area:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage of the Total Affected Area that is Comprised of Open Space\n<ul>\n<li>Open space is any area that is not otherwise occupied by a building or other structure.  Examples of open spaces include parking lots, sidewalks, parks, greenways, roadways, and plazas.  For the purposes of this estimator, bodies of water (lakes, rivers, streams, etc.) can be included as open space, but waste estimates resulting from removal or remediation of these features are not available in the WME.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Percentage of Open Space that is Comprised of Soil, Vegetation, Asphalt, and Concrete\n<ul>\n<li>\nSoil includes any area covered by grass, vegetation, or other landscaping and that is not covered by asphalt, concrete, or another improved surface type.  The percentage of vegetation in an affected area can, and will, overlap with the percentage of soil.  For example, a city park with an area of one square mile may consist of 70% soil, 5% water, 15% asphalt, and 10% concrete.  The same square mile may contain various types of vegetation (trees, shrubs, etc.) that makes up approximately 60% of the total park area, or 0.6 square miles.  If a user is interested in generating waste estimates only for the city park in the above example, then the following values would be entered in the open space parameter values:\n</li>\n<li>Percent of open space that is:\n<ul>\n<li>Soil (%): 70</li>\n<li>Vegetation (%): 60</li>\n<li>Asphalt (%): 15</li>\n<li>Concrete (%): 10</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Depth of Surface Material Removed\n<ul>\n<li>\nDepending upon the nature of the incident, different decontamination and/or remediation strategies may be employed to decontaminate soils, asphalt, and concrete surfaces.  Some of those strategies may include removing only the uppermost layers of the surface, deeper excavation, or complete removal.  For soil, asphalt, and concrete, users can enter an estimate of how much of the material will be removed from the surface.  For decontamination of some materials, this may involve removing only an inch or two from the surface.  Soils may require deeper excavation (e.g., 15 inches) to remove contamination, and to completely remove asphalt from a parking lot, for example, several inches of asphalt may be involved.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once all values are entered, users can continue to enter parameters for building structures (by entering quantities for the appropriate building structures) or click the “Generate Estimate” button to generate the waste estimates.</p>",
